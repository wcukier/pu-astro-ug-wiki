## Prereqs

The astronomy department has 3 main prerequesite tracks that you must complete

- Physics through PHY207
- Math through Multivariable and Linear Algebra
- AST 204

Note that there is a decent amount of flexibility in the tracks: 

For Physics PHY 103 / PHY 105 and PHY 104 / PHY 106 are interchangeable.  

For Math MAT 201 / MAT 203 / MAT 216 / MAT 300 are interchangeable, along with MAT 202 / MAT 204 / MAT 217 / MAT 218.

## Which Physics Class should I choose?
A large amount of astrophysics majors enter the major from PHY 103 - PHY 104 sequence.  People who start in PHY 103 get the same degree as those who start in PHY 105.  Which class you start in is largely a reflection of you high school's course offerings and academic preparation -- not your academic abilities.

You should probably start in **PHY 105** if
- You have already taken a calculus based mechanics class
- You have a strong calculus background and are interested in taking a more difficult class

You should probably start in **PHY 103** if
- You have never taken a calculus based mechanics class
- You want to take a semester or two to adjust to Princeton
- You want to take a difficult class in another department
