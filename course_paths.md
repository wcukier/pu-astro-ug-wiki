## Prereqs

The astronomy department has 3 main prerequesite tracks that you must complete

- Physics through PHY207
- Math through Multivariable and Linear Algebra
- AST 204

Note that there is a decent amount of flexibility in the tracks: 

For Physics PHY 103 / PHY 105 and PHY 104 / PHY 106 and ISC are interchangeable.

For Math MAT 201 / MAT 203 / MAT 216 / MAT 300 are interchangeable, along with MAT 202 / MAT 204 / MAT 217 / MAT 218.

Also note, if you are behind on your prereqs due to having a low math background or deciding you wanted to do physics late, talk to Neta Bahcall, the Director of Undergraduate Studies in astro, and it will be fine.

### Which Physics Class should I choose?
A large amount of astrophysics majors enter the major from PHY 103 - PHY 104 sequence.  People who start in PHY 103 get the same degree as those who start in PHY 105.  Which class you start in is largely a reflection of you high school's course offerings and academic preparation -- not your academic abilities.

You should probably start in **PHY 105** if
- You have already taken a calculus based mechanics class
- You have a strong calculus background and are interested in taking a more difficult class
- You are not taking difficult classes in other departments

You should probably start in **PHY 103** if
- You have never taken a calculus based mechanics class
- You want to take a semester or two to adjust to Princeton
- You want to take a difficult class in another department

You should probably start in **ISC** if
- You are considering multiple science majors
- You do not have AP credit in any science or are willing to forfeit it
- You want a hard course with a tight knit community

### Which Math Class should I choose?
There is even less reason to push yourself to take harder math classes than physics classes. MAT 103-MAT 104-MAT 201-MAT 202 is more than sufficient for pretty much all the classes you want to take.

The math department has a guide to the intro sequences [here](https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/placement/sequences) if you want to read more specifics in the classes.

You should start in **MAT 103** if
- You are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with single variable derivative calculus

You should start in **MAT 103** if
- You are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with single variable integral calculus

You should start in **MAT 201** if
- You are comfortable with BC-Calc level material
- You don't think you want to be a math major or a theoretical physicist

You should start in **MAT 203** if
- You are comfortable with BC-Calc level material
- You want to take a harder class
- You want to take a smaller class and are willing for it to be harder for that to be the case
- You at least want to try some proof-based math
- You want to do theoretical physics potentially

You should start in **MAT 215** if
- You want to take a rigorous proof-based math class
- You want to take a really hard class
- You are not taking difficult classes in other departments
- You might want to be a math major or do theoretical physics
- You are willing to take an extra semester of math to cover the multivariable requirement

You should start in **MAT 216** if
- Don't
- You have alrady taken proof based analysis
- You are not taking difficult classes in other departments
- You want your classmates to be IMO level
- You want to squeeze three really hard math classes into two semesters

### When should I take AST 204
Reccomendation -- First Year Spring semester but it doesnt really matter if you take it now or later
